# esvu

esvu is your one-stop shop for all implementations of ECMAScript.

## Installation

```
$ npm i -g esvu
```

esvu will attempt to respect `XDG_DATA_HOME`, and will fall back to the
home directory. You will need to add esvu's bin to your `PATH`, for
example `$XDG_DATA_HOME/.esvu/bin` or `/home/snek/.esvu/bin`.

You may override the path entirely by setting the `ESVU_PATH` environment
variable.

## Usage

The first time you run `esvu`, it will ask you which engines you wish to
install. After the first run, running `esvu` will update the engines you
selected.

- `$ esvu`
  Update all installed engines, or select engines to install
- `$ esvu install <engine>`
  Install the engine `<engine>`
- `$ esvu uninstall <engine>`
  Uninstall `<engine>`
- `$ esvu update <engine>`
  Update `<engine>`. Like `install` but the engine must have been previously
  installed.

If you're using [eshost-cli][], you can run `eshost --configure-esvu` after
installing engines to make eshost automatically find the installed engines.
